JavaScript Scopes, Hoisting, and Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)
This README provides an overview of three important JavaScript concepts: Scopes, Hoisting, and the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ). It includes code examples and visual aids to help you understand each concept more clearly.

1. Scopes
What is Scope?
In JavaScript, scope refers to the current context of execution, which determines the accessibility of variables and functions. There are two primary types of scope in JavaScript:

Global Scope: Variables declared outside of any function or block are in the global scope.
Local Scope: Variables declared inside a function or block are in the local scope.
Types of Scopes in JavaScript:
Global Scope: Variables declared outside any function are globally accessible.
Function Scope: Variables declared inside a function are only accessible within that function.
Block Scope: Variables declared with let and const are block-scoped (accessible only within the block, such as within loops or conditionals).
Example:
javascript
Копировать код
// Global Scope
let globalVar = "I am global";

function myFunction() {
  // Local Scope
  let localVar = "I am local";
  console.log(globalVar); // Accessing global variable
  console.log(localVar);  // Accessing local variable
}

myFunction();

console.log(globalVar);  // Accessible outside the function
console.log(localVar);   // Error: localVar is not defined

2. Hoisting
What is Hoisting?
Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top of their containing scope during compilation. Hoisting affects variable and function declarations differently:

Function Declarations: Hoisted entirely, so you can call a function before it's defined.
Variable Declarations: Only the declaration part is hoisted, not the initialization. This leads to issues like accessing variables before they are assigned a value.
Example:
javascript
Копировать код
// Function hoisting
myFunction(); // Works because function declarations are hoisted

function myFunction() {
  console.log("Hello, World!");
}

// Variable hoisting
console.log(myVar);  // Undefined due to hoisting
var myVar = "I am hoisted";

3. Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)
What is the Temporal Dead Zone?
The Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) is a behavior in JavaScript when variables declared with let and const are accessed before their declaration in the code. The TDZ occurs between the entering of the scope and the actual declaration of the variable. During this time, the variable is in an "uninitialized" state and accessing it throws a ReferenceError.

Example:
javascript
Копировать код
console.log(myVar); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'myVar' before initialization
let myVar = "TDZ Example";
TDZ Behavior
The code below demonstrates how let and const variables are affected by the TDZ:

javascript
Копировать код
function testTDZ() {
  console.log(myLet); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'myLet' before initialization
  let myLet = "I'm inside TDZ";
}
